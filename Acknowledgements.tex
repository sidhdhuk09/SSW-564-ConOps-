The team at ClauseGuard, also known as Team-7, wishes to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude to our esteemed professor, Dr. Muresan, David Darian whose valuable guidance, unwavering support, and thoughtful insights have been instrumental in shaping this project. 

We would also like to acknowledge the steadfast support and patience of our families. Their understanding and encouragement during the many hours devoted to this project have been a source of comfort and constant motivation. Without their faith in our abilities, and their constant encouragement during the challenging moments, the successful completion of this project would have been considerably more difficult if not downright impossible.
