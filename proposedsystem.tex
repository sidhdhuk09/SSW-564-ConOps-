\section{Background, objectives, and scope \label{Section::Background,objectives,and scope proposed}}
The rationale for the proposed approach is that it can be challenging for people to spot fraudulent elements in contracts since they are sometimes buried within lengthy and complicated terms and conditions. The suggested system's goal is to identify dishonest clauses in contracts using machine learning techniques, which will increase the contracts' fairness and transparency for all parties. The proposed system's scope includes contract analysis across a range of industries, including technology, insurance, and financial services.


\section{Operational policies and constraints \label{Section::Operational Policies and Constraints proposed}}
The system must make sure that user data is not abused or disclosed without permission, and that the data it gathers and analyzes is handled securely and confidentially.
The system must be precise and trustworthy in spotting contract fraud. The algorithms and outcomes of the system must be rigorously tested and validated for this.


\section{Description of the proposed system \label{Section::Description of the proposed System proposed}}
To find potentially dishonest clauses in contracts, the suggested method will employ machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. Contracts will be analyzed by the system, and any clauses that seem to be unfair, misleading, or deceptive will be flagged. The system will also explain its findings so that consumers may comprehend the justification for the system's choices.



\section{Modes of operation \label{Section::Modes of operation proposed}}

The suggested system will function in two different ways:

In manual mode, a user can upload a contract to the system for analysis, and the system will then give that analysis.

Real-time mode, when the system continuously checks contracts for dishonest clauses and alerts the user to any potential problems.


\section{User classes and other involved personnel \label{Section::User Classes and other involved personnel proposed}}
People and organizations involved in contract formulation and approval will make use of the suggested system. These professionals working with contracts include attorneys, contract managers, compliance officers, and others. Additionally, the system will work with specialists in machine learning who will be in charge of enhancing and refining the system's algorithms.


\section{Support environment \label{Section::Support Environment proposed}}
User guides, online help, and a customer service team will all be part of the support system for the planned system. The system will also include a feedback tool that will let users comment on how well the system is working and recommend changes. To guarantee that the system is operating at its peak performance, routine upgrades and maintenance will be offered.
