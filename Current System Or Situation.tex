\section{Background, objectives, and scope \label{Section::Background,objectives and scope} }
% The primary purpose of this project is to protect stakeholders from falling victim to deceptive clauses in contracts that may undermine their best interests, either intentionally or unintentionally or via other disruptive means. These clauses could cause harm to the signing party through various means, such as monetary loss or other negative consequences that may impact the livelihood of the concerned stakeholder as a whole. The proposed machine learning software system aims to detect and flag such fraudulent clauses in terms and conditions contracts, thus empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions before committing to an agreement.

% By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the system will analyze and identify potential risks in the contract language. This approach ensures that stakeholders are aware of any hidden or obscure terms that could be detrimental to their interests. In addition to enhancing the transparency of contractual agreements upheld in a court of law, the software will enable users to negotiate better terms, minimize potential disputes, and ultimately establish a more secure and trustworthy contractual environment.
